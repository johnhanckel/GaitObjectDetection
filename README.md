# GaitObjectDetection
At its core, this is a list of python scripts that provides the step by step progression from initial object detection code to implementing it to identify yellow socks with the Intel RealSense d435i Depth Sensor.
This will require the following packages to run the various scripts, depending on their respective imports:
pyrealsense2
numpy
imutils
cv2

I primarily set up my Raspberry Pi 4 using the following youtube video, but I highly recommend to double check your work with his description links to github that also explains the setup: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBIBUntnxp8
